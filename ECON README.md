# Econonomic-Forecasting-Project-

Description:
The data set includes the start dates, end dates, no of sales in yearly base for retail furniture and home furniture sales from 1992- 2018.

Data set link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/brwalk/an-introduction-to-time-series-forecasting- in-r/data?select=retail-sales-furniture-and-home-furnishings-stores_1.csv

The data set has 4 variables: 
Realtime_startdate: starting date period
Realtime_enddate: end date period 
Date: actual dates
Value: Number of sales in the period.

Our project involves the following models i.e., Exponential smoothing (Naïve, Average methods, Simple exponential smoothing), 
Holt’s Linear trend, Holt-winters seasonality, 
ETS, 
Auto Regression, 
ARIMA 
to predict and forecast the sales of furniture for the next few years i.e., predict future values based on previously observed values. 
We have a 25+year furniture sales data.

From this dataset, we can see that there are no missing values for all the attributes, so we are not performing any preprocessing for this data.
